The best non-obtrusive call-to-actions possible: Scroll Triggered Boxes.

== Description ==

= Scroll Triggered Boxes =

Scroll triggered boxes are the best non-obtrusive way to ask your visitors to do something. Whether you want to ask them to subscribe to your newsletter, share the post they just read or do something entirely different: this plugin makes it easy.

Scroll Triggered Boxes are boxes that fade in when a user reach certain points on your pages. 

By then you can be sure those visitors are interested in your content, making this the perfect place to ask them something. A box that fades in at a corner of your visitors screen is a non obtrusive way to do so. 

**Features**

- Create an unlimited amount of boxes
- Control where and when a box should show-up
- Designing your boxes is simple yet effective.
- Use anything as the box content. Text, images, shortcodes, you decide!
- Set the number of days for which a box should stay hidden for users who closed it
